<h3><u>Choosing a safe cycling route</u></h3>
<p>Every cyclist has a story to tell about a near miss or collision. 
You often hear common themes like: "I got hit when a car pulled out right in front of me," or "the worst one I had was being 'car-doored' in the city." 
Some people get hit on the road more than others - is it just bad luck, or are they making bad decisions that could lead to their demise?
Probably one of the major decisions is a bad cycling route.</p>

potential game changer for the construction of anything that moves.<p>
